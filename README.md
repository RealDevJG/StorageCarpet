# Storage Carpet
*A Carpet mod extension dedicated to making Storage Tech easier*

## Setup

1. Edit build.gradle and mod.json to suit your needs.
    * The "mixins" object can be removed from mod.json if you do not need to use mixins.
    * Please replace all occurrences of "modid" with your own mod ID - sometimes, a different string may also suffice.
2. Run the following command:

```
./gradlew idea
```
